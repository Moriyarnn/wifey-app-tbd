# AppLayout — Column Layout System

`AppLayout.vue` is the multi-column layout wrapper used by every feature view. It provides a responsive column grid: side-by-side on desktop, and (planned) swipeable on mobile (#49). The columns are the same everywhere — only the navigation pattern changes per breakpoint.

## Breakpoints

| Breakpoint | Layout |
|---|---|
| <1280px | Transparent wrapper — feature view controls its own layout; column scroll planned (#49) |
| ≥1280px | 2-col grid: `minmax(0, 560px)` + `1fr` |
| ≥1600px | 3-col grid: `minmax(0, 560px)` + `1fr` + `1fr` |

Col 1 is capped at 560px because feature primary views (calendar, list, log form) are mobile-first UIs that shouldn't stretch. Cols 2 and 3 are `1fr` — they expand to fill remaining space, which suits charts, detail panels, and analytics.

## Column Intent

Each feature maps its content to columns using the same pattern:

| Column | Role | Tier |
|---|---|---|
| **Col 1** | Primary visual / browse / active task | Free |
| **Col 2** | Detail, context, stats, predictions | Free |
| **Col 3** | Advanced analytics, correlations, exports | Premium |

Col 3 being the natural home for premium content has a useful side effect: free users on mobile never see a locked panel — col 3 is simply absent below 1600px. On desktop, premium subscribers get a third panel that feels earned.

## Feature Column Map

### Period Tracker
| Col 1 | Col 2 | Col 3 |
|---|---|---|
| Calendar — the visual anchor | Phase card, predictions, symptom summary, data quality warnings | Cycle correlation trends, export, copy/paste day data (premium) |

### Pantry
| Col 1 | Col 2 | Col 3 |
|---|---|---|
| Shopping list — the active task | Pantry inventory with expiry states, "expiring soon" banner | Waste tracking, reorder suggestions, recipe crossover (premium) |

### Recipes
| Col 1 | Col 2 | Col 3 |
|---|---|---|
| Recipe card grid, phase-matched surfacing | Selected recipe detail (ingredients, steps) | Pantry crossover score, symptom-triggered suggestions (premium) |

### Exercise
| Col 1 | Col 2 | Col 3 |
|---|---|---|
| Log workout + weekly activity strip | Phase-aware suggestion, workout history | Cycle correlation, partner visibility (premium) |

### Sleep Tracker
| Col 1 | Col 2 | Col 3 |
|---|---|---|
| Log sleep + weekly duration chart | Sleep debt, basic insight, optimal duration | Partner sync overlay, cycle correlation (premium) |

## Component API

```vue
<AppLayout>
  <FeatureCol1 />
  <template #col2>
    <FeatureCol2 />
  </template>
  <template #col3>
    <FeatureCol3 />
  </template>
</AppLayout>
```

**Slots**

| Slot | Renders in | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| default | Col 1 (`.app-main-panel`) | Card styling on desktop, transparent pass-through on mobile |
| `col2` | Col 2 (`.app-side-panel`) | Shown at ≥1280px. Panel div not rendered if slot is empty. |
| `col3` | Col 3 (`.app-side-panel--third`) | Shown at ≥1600px. Panel div not rendered if slot is empty. |

If a feature has no col 3 content yet, omit `#col3` — the panel won't appear.

## Wiring Up a New Feature

1. Create `FeatureHome.vue` — thin wrapper, owns `AppLayout`:

```vue
<template>
  <AppLayout>
    <FeatureCol1 />
    <template #col2>
      <FeatureCol2 />
    </template>
    <template #col3>
      <FeatureCol3 />
    </template>
  </AppLayout>
</template>

<script setup>
import AppLayout from '../../components/AppLayout.vue'
import FeatureCol1 from './FeatureCol1.vue'
import FeatureCol2 from './FeatureCol2.vue'
import FeatureCol3 from './FeatureCol3.vue'
</script>
```

2. Create separate column components (`FeatureCol1.vue`, `FeatureCol2.vue`, `FeatureCol3.vue`). No shell dependencies. During early development you can pass the same placeholder component to all three slots and split them out when the desktop view is ready for polish.

3. Register the route pointing at `FeatureHome.vue`.

HubView and LogsDashboard are full-width single-column views — they do not use `AppLayout`.

## Planned: Mobile Column Scroll (#49)

On mobile, the columns will be navigable as a horizontal scroll or swipe carousel — same column components, same data, different navigation. `AppLayout` will own this behavior so individual feature views remain unaware of the navigation pattern.
